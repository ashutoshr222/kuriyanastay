                 <p>Unit at kuriyana stay is built keeping comfort and modern adaptation of traditional techniques in mind. We took inspiration from the traditional "kath-khuni" method and added our take on it. Rooms at kuriyana stay have been built using Himalayan cedar also known as "deodar". Flooring is also done with natural stone, This makes rooms warm and comfortable inside with a scent that is unique to deodar. </p>
                 <p>We have specifically planned kuriyana stay experience for cozy family vocations, a lively get-together of friends or couples on a romantic getaway. The two room sets are spacious with large windows to let in natural light and give a sense of openness. Both rooms include king size beds and a set of table and chair so you can sip on your tea while watching a sunset. Both rooms have oil heaters and a fireplace to keep it warm. </p>
                 <p>Large windows all around you giving you a nice view of forests while you read a book or listen to your favourite music under a thick blanket.</p>
